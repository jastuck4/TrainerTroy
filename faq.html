		<h2>Where do you hold workout sessions?</h2><p id="location"> I hold workout sessions primarily at the local YMCA and sometimes outdoors, particularly at Patriot Park. During warmer months I hold sessions both outside and at the YMCA, but try to limit outdoor workouts during the winter season. </p> <a href="#questions" class="questions">Return to top</a>

		<h2>Do you work with those with health issues(i.e diabetes)?</h2><p id="medical">I do work with those who may have health problems. Not to say that working out will heal any illness but I have had a few clients that have reported improvements since beginning working out. For new clients, I request certain information regarding their health so that I am made aware of any special precautions that need to be taken. </p><a href="#questions" class="questions">Return to top</a>

		<h2>What age range do you train?</h2><p id="age">I work with people as young as 18. There are specific certifications that go along with being able to train children. I would strongly advise that any parent or guardian ask this information before allowing their child to be trained.</p><a href="#questions" class="questions">Return to top</a>

		<h2>How do you maintain your fitness?</h2><p id="personl">There are many ways that I maintain my fitness. First and foremost is by keeping a healthy diet. Secondly, I stick to a schedule of working out 5 days a week with two days off (usually the weekend). It also helps me to do different things to keep myself motivated to stay fit and healthy like tough mudders, 5k's, and fitness challenges.</p><a href="#questions" class="questions">Return to top</a>

		<h2>What type of diets have you tried?</h2><p id="diet">I have tried a few diets before I came across one that really fit me. I've tried the strictly Paleo diet, the meditteranean diet, and the low carbs diet. I am now gluten free 24/7 and I add low carbs to that during the warmer months when I want to shred. There are pros and cons to all diets, you just have to find the one that best fits you.</p><a href="#questions" class="questions">Return to top</a>
