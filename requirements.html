				<td>I included nine images, three of which are hyperlinked to the personal trainer’s social media pages. I also included hyperlinked screenshots of both the requirements document and sitemap, both of which can be viewed in full by clicking on the image. Text is positioned either in a separate column or right beneath text so that there is not too much empty space or trapped whitespace.<br><br>
				All images are saved with an appropriate resolution. All images have the correct path and are broken
				Included in the gallery page is an originally created fitness motivation video. <br><br>
				The web form is included in the contact me page. The form has three text input areas (first name, last name, email), a text box (message area), a selection list (subject), and a checkbox (gender selection). When the form is filled out correctly and the submit button is pressed, the user is prompted to open their email app to send their email. If a required area is not filled out, the user will be prompted to complete that field. <br><br>
				My form includes two legends and two fieldsets.<br><br>
				My form includes seven labels (First name, last name, email, subject, message, male, and female and each have been assigned a tabindex in sequential order according to their positioning on the form. <br><br>

				My form contains three required fields indicated by an asterisk, first name, last name, and email. <br><br>
				I implemented a free JavaScript code that validates all of my form’s required fields for input. If a required field is left blank, the user will be prompted to fill it out.

			<tr>
				<td><strong>Technical Requirements</strong></td>
				<td>CSS: The majority of formatting for your site is handled via an External Style Sheet (.css)<br><br>

				<td>I have included four external style sheets and have minimal internal styling. 
				All pages validated with no areas and have an icon that links to the validation in the bottom right corner of each corresponding page.<br><br>
				I added to the code of the JavaScript file that I included from the web. I added validation for all required fields in my contact form instead of just the email field. <br><br>
				The gallery page includes a CSS based photo gallery that enlarges images when they are hovered over. Each page contains an in-site search bar located in the top right corner of every page.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>Design and Usability</strong></td>
				<td>The site demonstrates an understanding of the 4 Page Layout Principles as described in class: Contrast, Proximity, Alignment, and Repetition<br><br>
				Site navigation is easy to use<br><br>
				The text is of a size, color, and style that is easy to read on the chosen background color or graphic<br><br>
				Text and graphic placement is visually appealing<br><br>
				There are unifying elements that make the pages seem that they belong together<br><br>
				Search Engine Optimization: 

				Each page should have meta tags that are appropriate to that page including <br>

				•	Description<br>
				•	Keywords<br>
				•	Robots<br>
				•	Author<br>
				•	copyright tags.<br><br>
				Your site includes an XML Sitemap</td>
				<td>Contrast: Active pages are made to have a different background color and height from inactive pages. Images that are hovered over within the gallery are made to be enlarged so that it stands out from those that are not being viewed. <br><br>
				Proximity: Client testimonials are made to connect to the client’s image to show relationship. The additional links are all grouped together in a list within the footer. The validation information for the pages are also grouped together within the footer.  The content is divided by the use of headers so that the user knows what each section is.<br><br>
				Alignment: I used the end of the search bar and the beginning of the navigation bar as markers to note where to place certain elements. <br><br>
				Repetition: I repeated all style elements on all pages. All main headers are greatly enlarged to the same size and all subject headers have a different background color from other elements on the site.<br><br> 
				The site navigation links are clearly named for what that particular page is about. Whenever a page is active, it distinctly stands out from the rest so that the user knows where they are. <br><br>
				The font color is white on a black background for the main content and white on a red background for the navigation and footer. The header image’s text is also easy to read with the font being black and dark grey on a white background. The font style is Arial, which is easy to make out. I also adjusted the line height so that the spacing between paragraph lines doesn’t tire the eyes as much. Even though I have the main content on a textured background, it does not interfere with readability of content because of the subtlety. <br><br>
				The text and graphics are placed according to relationship. The gallery page contains graphics that relate to fitness transformation and motivation, the about me page contains graphics highlighting the personal trainer, and the contact page has a graphic motivating users to start training. I also included a header image that stands out but is not visually overwhelming. All images are proportional, clear, and professional looking. 
				All pages are designated to a specific topic. Graphics that are included on some of the pages are only included as they relate to the content of that page. I also made active pages the same background as the main content so that it stands out from the inactive pages, which remains with a red background. <br><br>
				I included a description, keywords, robots, author, and a copyright tag in the head section of the html document. 
				The XML sitemap can be linked to by going to the Sitemap page and clicking the sitemap image.
